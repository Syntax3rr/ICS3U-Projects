# ICS3U-Projects
My ICS3U Final Project, as well as the ungraded projects I did for fun, which led up to it.
All of this is based off of my original JS platformer engine, I started around grade 7-8.
These are all made to run in a specific Python-Based engine from the CMU CS Academy, which is meant more for making images, or very simple games.
Note: Physics in the game are a little wonky since I didn't know about things like tunneling or interpolation when I created this

The final project, a 2D Portal renake, can be found here: (Note: This is atrociously slow)

The first project, a simple pixel-art drawer:

A simple text display-er, using the same basic code from before as a base: (Note: Pressing the restart button will randomly choose some text to display)

An improved text display-er:

A text editor (more or less) based off the same idea: (Note: This is especially slow, due to the program needing to redraw every pixel every edit)

Things I Learned:
- Python
- Portal-physics
- Adding features to a pre-existing program
- The design process
